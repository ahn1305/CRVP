## Want to run the project without any fuss (in windows), follow these steps

Before doing this step you have to create a virtualenvironment using python.

```
pip install virtualenv
python -m venv venv
```

After doing this you can run the bat file "runapp.bat" by double clicking it, so you don't have to activate the virtualenv and run the flask server everytime.

Note: <b>Ensure that the virtualenv is in the same folder where the project is present</b>
